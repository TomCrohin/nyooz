Using [hexo](//hexo.io).

## Add/edit a post

Simply add or edit markdown files in [source/_post](./source/_post) folder.  
There's templates in [scaffolds](./scaffolds).

Follow Hexo's [documentation](//hexo.io/docs/writing) for writing.

### Deploy

You don't need to do anything. There's a [workflow](./.github/workflows/deploy.yml) configured to build & deploy the blog _on each commit_. You can see the progress of the deploy workflow on the [Actions](//github.com/becodeorg/nyooz/actions) tab of the repository.

> ðŸ‘‰ **NOTE:** there's a small _cache TTL_ on GitHub Pages - you may need to wait up to ten minutes to see your changes online.
